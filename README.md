This prototype is part of university coursework.<br>
Timeframe: **01/02/25 - 11/04/25** <br>
<br>
Built using - _Python_, _Flask_, (mroe TBC)...

#### Project Brief
> You are approached by an enthusiastic friend looking to create a Web App enabling people to publicly express their objection to creative tax avoidance, unfair employment
practices, racism, disregard of environmental impact and other unethical business and political practices. The idea is that users will be able to add their signatures under a
petition, which can be created by other members, supporting the petition, and pledging not to do business or otherwise deal with the misbehaving entity highlighted in the
petition.
>
>> Features Required:
>> 1. Create Member accounts
>> 2. Members can create new Petitions with basic properties like a short title, a picture representation, a description, etc.
>> 3. All users should be able to see all/popular Petitions
>> 4. Ability to electronically sign under Petitions using a Member account
>> 5. The related information of signed Petitions should be visible to anyone. This includes aspects like a list of names who have signed, a counter of how many people have signed, etc.
>> 6. There is a special “Admin” account that can keep track of Members and Petitions. The admin can temporarily block Members, and can also delete Petitions
>> 7. Authenticate users based on their role (Member/Admin)
>> 8. The website must follow a responsive design so that it can be adaptable to different devices
>> 9. Ability to see signature counts and actual new signatures as they happen
>> 10. Ability to share causes on social media like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit etc
